Emojifier is a model that takes as input a text and return as output an emoji from a list of 5 emojis available.

Two models were developed :

	- model 1 : cnn model using multiple CNN layers 
	- model 2 : using Glove for pretrainde Embedding and LSTM layers 
    - model 3 : using Bert for transfer learning 


The metric used in this problem is Accuracy.
Results obtained :
	
	model 1 :
		train_acc = 0.4697 - test_acc = 0.4821
	model 2 :
		train_acc =  0.8788 - test_acc: 0.7500
	model 3 :
	    train_acc = 1.0000  - test_acc = 0.8393
